I'm a geek, a teacher and scientist.

<span class="fa fa-flask about-icon"></span> 
I'm a project manager for the <a href="https://commonfund.nih.gov/commons">Data Commons Pilot Phase Consortium</a>. I do a lot of GitHub wrangling, report managment, and general chaos quelling :)

<p class="about-text">
<span class="fa fa-code about-icon"></span> 
I write/code in <strong>R</strong>, <strong>LaTeX</strong>, <strong>Markdown</strong>, and <strong>BASH</strong> with gusto, <strong>Python</strong> when pressed, and dabble in <strong>make</strong>, <strong>Rst</strong>, <strong>html</strong>, <strong>sql</strong>, and whatever else seems interesting at the time.

<span class="fa fa-graduation-cap about-icon"></span>
I recently graduated from Michigan State University where my PhD work focused on finding the genetic underpinnings of weediness. I worked on <i>Raphanus raphanistrum</i> (that's radishes), and compared the genomes of crop radish, weedy radish and (non-weedy) wild radish to see what genes differ between ecotypes. I also have a dual B.A. in Biochemistry and Criminal Justice from <a href="http://www.olivetcollege.edu/">Olivet College</a>
