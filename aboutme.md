I'm a geek, a teacher and scientist. 

<span class="fa fa-graduation-cap about-icon"></span> Currently, I'm attending Michigan State University where my graduate work focuses on finding the genetic underpinnings of weediness. I work on *Raphanus raphanistrum* (that's radishes), and I'm comparing the genomes of crop radish, weedy radish and (non-weedy) wild radish to see what genes differ between ecotypes.
